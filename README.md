## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8+
- FastAPI
- Pydantic
- Groq API Key (you can get one from [Groq's website](https://groq.com))
- Dotenv for managing environment variables

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/groq-chatbot-fastapi.git
    cd groq-chatbot-fastapi
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Set up your environment variables:
   - Create an `.env` file inside the `app/` folder.
   - Add your Groq API key:
     ```bash
     GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
     ```

4. Run the application:
    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```

5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` to interact with the chatbot.

## How It Works
1. **Frontend**: The user interacts with the web interface (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) by submitting a message.
2. **Backend**: The message is sent to the FastAPI backend for processing.
3. **Groq API**: The FastAPI backend sends the message to the Groq API, which processes it and returns a response.
4. **Response**: The chatbot sends the response back to the frontend, where the user can view the reply and continue the conversation.

## Future Enhancements
- **Persistent Chat History**: Store chat conversations in a database for future reference.
- **Enhanced UI**: Improve the frontend design with additional styling and interactive elements.
- **Customizable Models**: Allow users to select from multiple AI models for different conversational experiences.
